## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a TDEE calculator allowing users to see their current and future expenditure based on their activity level. Ideally, the output will also show users the difference in their current TDEE and future TDEE in terms of high density foods.
### Features
Current TDEE: users will be able to see their current energy expenditure estimate.

Future TDEE: users will be able to see an estimate of their future TDEE at various activity levels.

Calorie Visualization: users will be able to see the difference in expenditure in terms of high density foods such as donuts, pizza, tacos, etc.

Progress Visulization: users will be able to see where they are at on their journey currently in terms of calories already expended and calories left to be expended.
