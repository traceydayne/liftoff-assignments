## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a debt payoff calculator using at least two commonly touted methods for paying off debt quickly. It will allow for comparison of those methods against each other and against simply paying the minimum payment over time. Additionally, it will also display the power of compounding via the stock market allowing users to see how their funds can work for them. Users will be able to run simulations and edit information in order to make informed financial decisions.
### Features
Minimum payoff: users will be able to see just how long and how much interest they'll pay by making the minimum payments set forth by the lender.
Snowball payoff: users will be able to see a comparison between paying their debts in order of smallest to largest principal vs paying the minimums.
Avalanche payoff: similar comparison to snowball however debts are ordered highest to lowest interest rate.
Compounding Power: users will be able to see what their funds can grow to over a desired length of time in order to decide if a debt is worth paying down quickly or over time.
